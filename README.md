# CodeClause_URL_Shortner
- This is a Python script that creates a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for a URL shortener tool using the tkinter module. The GUI has a heading, a label asking for the user's input, an entry field for the user to enter the URL, an image-based button to execute the URL shortening functionality, and a label to display the resulting shortened URL. The resulting shortend URL will be directly copied to the clipboard.

- The script uses the pyperclip, urllib, and PIL (Python Imaging Library) modules. pyperclip is used to copy the resulting shortened URL to the clipboard, urllib is used to handle URL encoding and make the HTTP request to the TinyURL API, and PIL is used to load and display the image button.

- This script provides a simple and easy-to-use GUI for a URL shortener tool. 
- The screenshots of the GUI window is attached below
